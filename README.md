   This research examines the relationship between school funding and youth crime perceptions across various societal roles, such as parents, teachers, policymakers, community members, and school administrators. Through a detailed analysis of survey data, the study explores how these different groups perceive the effectiveness of school funding in reducing youth crime, particularly through interventions like vocational training and after-school programs.      The results reveal that stakeholders’ perceptions vary significantly, with some, such as community members and policymakers, expressing skepticism about the impact of school funding, while others, like parents and teachers, hold more diverse views. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of vocational training in lowering youth crime rates. This research contributes valuable insights to the ongoing discussion on how education policies, particularly funding allocations, can influence public safety and suggests that targeted educational interventions and clearer communication strategies are needed to align public perceptions with the outcomes of these investments.
